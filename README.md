## **Overview**

In this assingment I will be attempting Coding Temple's OOP Principals task, where I should cover more on classes as well as, subclasses, overriding methods, private and protected members


### `budget_category.py`

inside this module contains the class "*Budgetcategory*" which takes in a budget type or category name as well as the budget amount. This class also comes with 5 methods

- `Get_Category`
- `Get_Budget`
- `Set_Category`
- `Set_Budget`
- `Add_Expenses`
